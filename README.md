LSApp
=====

LSApp is a lifestyle app that enables you to capture and organize your lifestyle moments. 

The Problem
=====

Our current social network allows us to upload our photos and tag them with friends' name or hash (#) tags.
Tagging our photos with friends is fine, but the problem is with hash tags, especially when we are tagging objects. As tags can be any keyword and the english language contains many synonyms for to describe the same thing, you might not get all the data from a search if you only use certain keywords.

The Solution
=====

By only allowing users to select keywords from a pool of keywords, we can control what tags are being used, which results in more accurate searches. We organize the keywords in a hierarchical fashion, in order of categories, brand, and models.
